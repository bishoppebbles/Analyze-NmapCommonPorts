# Analyze-NmapCommonPorts
Displays IP addresses of systems with common open ports based on Nmap's XML formatted output.  It also displays systems that have more than one port open for protocols common to printing.

This script utilizes the Parse-Nmap.ps1 cmdlet by @JasonFossen of Enclave Consulting to parse Nmap's XML output file.  That script, among others, is available to download from <https://github.com/EnclaveConsulting/SANS-SEC505>.
